description: >-
  This is the lecture notes (in German) of my lecture 'Molecular Physics 
  and Solid State Physics I', as used in the winter semester 21/22. It 
  is a lecture for students in the third year of the Bachelor's programme. 
  In the selection and weighting of the topics, it is very closely 
  oriented to what is usual in Bayreuth.
